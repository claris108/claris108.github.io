Sandro Botticelli’s late 15th century painting Primavera and Claude Monet’s 1872 painting Madame Monet and a Friend in the Garden are two superficially similar works of art, depicting figures standing in among plants and trees. By comparing them, we can further understand the drastic social and cultural evolution that the Western world experienced over these centuries.

Fundamentally, art is a reflection of society and culture. Artists not only reflect the influences of their current cultural surroundings, but they also contribute to culture, moving it forward into new frontiers over the centuries. By understanding and analyzing art, we can further our understanding of the development of Western culture itself.  Historical shifts in artistic tradition reflect major changes in the history of Western culture. Edmund Burke describes art as serving three primary functions, “to satisfy our personal needs for expression, our social need for communication, celebration and display, and our physical need for useful objects and structures.” (Burke 11) For much of art’s history, it primarily served two of those functions, as objects of ownership, and objects of display. It was not until the rise of Impressionism in the late 19th century, relatively recently, that the third and final aspect of art, personal expression, truly began becoming apparent in European art culture.

Beginning with the Classical style of art associated with the ancient Romans and Greeks, Western ideas of art were first established, especially in sculpture and architecture. After the fall of the Roman empire in 476 AD, these classical ideals lost their cultural influence, and the world transitioned into the Medieval period. Medieval art lacked many classical ideals, especially regarding perspective. Instead, art served a religious function, to inspire devotion in illiterate Christians across Europe. In the 14th century, the Renaissance sought to revive classical ideals. Renaissance ideals would have a continuing influence on art for the next three centuries. This period of traditional oil painting lasted from the end of the Renaissance, upon Michaelangelo’s death in 1564, until the emergence of the Impressionists in the latter half of the 1800s. This period of oil painting is when cultural attitudes regarding high art in Europe were established. The ruling classes and art academies of Europe held certain values that high art needed to fulfill. After three hundred years of cultural domination, traditional oil painting was challenged by the emergence of a radical art movement, Impressionism. Our primary focus is this cultural shift, from Renaissance painting in the 14th century, to the emergence of modern art in the 19th century as seen in the rise of Impressionism.

Through the comparison of two paintings, Sandro Botticelli’s late 15th century painting Primavera and Claude Monet’s 1872 painting Madame Monet and a Friend in the Garden, we can further understand the drastic social and cultural evolution that the Western world experienced over this time. The center of the art world would change from Florence to Paris, the birthplaces of both Botticelli and Monet respectively. This change would see art go from being an intellectual expression primarily for the elite class, to something more modern. The function of art itself, the role it played in society, changed during this time as well. On the surface, the paintings have superficial similarities, making them easy to compare. Both paintings contain human figures in a lush, garden-like setting. However, they have significant differences.

## Botticelli's Primavera

During his life, the Renaissance was flourishing in Sandro Botticelli’s birthplace of Florence. Botticelli’s Primavera reflects the Renaissance culture of Florence through its synthesis of realistic technique and mythological symbolism. It also reflects the influence that the tastes of the wealthy and socially powerful had on art. The Primavera was most likely commissioned by the Medici family, who were at the center of the development of the Renaissance in Florence. Socially dominant families such as the Medici commissioned art in order to reflect well upon themselves, speaking to their level of cultural sophistication. As is typical of the Renaissance, art served this function, an expression of the tastes of the elite classes and socially dominant. The painting itself is painted with tempera, on a large wood panel. While Renaissance artists are typically associated with oil painting, Botticelli pushed tempera painting to its limit, achieving remarkable realism on a large scale. The painting’s large size contributes to its function as an object of display for the Medici family. The massive scale and intricate detail of the painting meant it could be admired for hours by guests visiting the Medici family estate.

The subjects of the Primavera are not ordinary people, but mythological figures of enormous significance. Each detail is painted with naturalistic realism, heavy with symbolic importance. This fusion of realism and deep symbolism is a trait most Renaissance paintings share. The title, Primavera, means “spring.” The exact meaning of this painting is argued, but it is clear that it is a mythological scene representing the changing of the seasons to spring. Venus and Mercury are present, along with Flora, a goddess of flowers, the Three Graces, with a Cupid overhead. Overall, the complex imagery of the painting is believed to be inspired by classical Roman poetry. “One poem in particular, “De Rerum Nature” by Lucretius, is thought to be Botticelli’s primary source of inspiration.” (Alston 10)

The Primavera contains some remaining influence from Medieval art, especially in terms of perspective and the arrangement of the figures and overall perspective. The flat, somewhat shallow perspective with the figures standing on roughly the same horizontal plane is similar to Medieval art. This, along with the use of tempera paint, gives Botticelli his unique style that marks the transition from Medieval to Renaissance art. Compared to the works of the Renaissance masters, Botticelli’s outlines are darker, and colors somewhat less realistically blended. While the Primavera contains some influence from earlier Medieval art, it is still very much a Renaissance image in terms of technique. Renaissance ideals demanded realism, and the Primavera overall displays a realistic style. No brushstrokes are visible, the illusion of reality carefully crafted. Color is naturalistic, and little stylization or abstraction is present. This mastery of technique to create the illusion of real figures in a real space was the ideal in Renaissance art. The Primavera is a typical Renaissance image in that it focuses on carefully posed, realistically proportioned human figures. The background serves to highly the symbolism of the painting, placing the gods in a lush, blooming setting. Many types of plant species are present, "190 different species of flower, more than 100 of which have been identified." (Primavera 2) This reflects the Renaissance emphasis on naturalistic, scientific accuracy in art.

Botticelli’s Primavera tells us that society and art at this time was dominated by the educated, upper classes of Europe, who began displaying "an increasing awareness of history," (Berger 10) and had an interest in reviving the cultural and intellectual traditions of classical antiquity. The "newly discovered technique of perspective" gave Renaissance artists "access to graphic and mathematical rules that enabled him to reproduce on paper or another flat surface, with scientific accuracy, the appearance of three-dimensional reality." (Conti 3) These were the ideals that served as the foundation for the oil painting tradition that dominated European art for the next three hundred years, until the Impressionists arrived and challenged these deeply ingrained values.

## Impressionism and the Renaissance
The Impressionists created their work during the booming years of the Industrial Revolution, and this societal shift is evident in their art. During the Renaissance, life moved relatively slowly, as did art. Mass production and technology had not yet influenced most aspects of culture. By the middle of the 19th century, society was changing into something much faster paced, with technology influencing more aspects of modern life. The role of the artist, and the function of art, came into question with the development of the photograph. Artists were no longer the sole possible source of realistic images. Impressionists realized that trying to reproduce reality was not the sole goal of art. Instead, they painted their subjective views, snapshots of brief moments captured with expressive technique, rather than the realistic detail and perfect accuracy characteristic of the Renaissance.

Claude Monet was "undoubtedly the central figure of the Impressionist movement—he even, unintentionally, was responsible for the group's name." (Hurwitz 2) Monet’s painting Madame Monet and a Friend in the Garden is representative of the Impressionist movement, both in terms of visual form and approach. The breaks from tradition and innovations that the Impressionists developed are on display in this piece. The content of the painting is simple, an ordinary scene of his wife relaxing with a friend. Quite different from the “high art” that the Salon and Academy valued, it is a candid scene, painted with dynamic and expressive technique. The bold, visible brush strokes and vivid colors associated with Impressionism are a clear rejection of the carefully constructed classical ideals of harmony, perspective, balance, and realism associated with fine art of the time.

The large, unmixed strokes of paint that the Impressionists are known for could not have been achieved at any other time. Technological advancements in the industrial manufacturing of paint allowed the Impressionists access to more paint and more colors than had been previously possible. Impressionists worked quickly, often outside, using pre-made paint to capture fleeting moments in time. This emphasis on working quickly, using bold and expressive colors to capture natural light from outdoor settings, is very different from the rigidly posed and deliberately detailed studio paintings typical of the Renaissance. Brush strokes were plainly visible, something that was considered unrefined and sloppy by critics, who largely preferred history painting.
The painting’s title plainly describes the scene, and little to no symbolism is present, it is not even clear what type of book Madame Monet is reading. This aligns with Impressionist emphasis on ordinary subject matter. Capturing particular details is not as important as capturing the subjective feelings the artist felt in this brief moment in time. Monet’s goal with his work was not to appease the tastes of cultural elites, but rather to capture a transient moment in his life. The subjects are not mythological figures of symbolic importance, but simply his wife and an unnamed friend. This reflects the shifting worldview of European society and culture, how the influence of elite, high art culture came to have less importance in determining what had artistic value.

Compared to Botticelli, Monet’s work is much more abstract. The figures are less detailed and more stylized, taking up more of the visual space. There is less symmetry and rigidity in the composition. Colors are vivid as opposed to naturalistic, in order to capture the quality of natural light. Unlike Botticelli’s scientific accuracy in depicting the surrounding flowers and trees, there are no identifiable plant species in Monet’s painting, showing that this type of realism was not a priority for Impressionists. 

An important characteristic of Impressionist art is the relationship between background and foreground. In classical painting, figures were always present, "no Renaissance artist ever painted a landscape for its own sake, or a group of people engaged in informal conversation." (Hale 103) Impressionists challenged this primarily by treating pure landscapes as their own subject matter for the first time. In addition to this, the distinction between subject and background was blurred. Another leading Impressionist, Renoir, "encouraged Monet to fill his landscapes with people and then merge the two, blurring distinctions." (Hill). Less emphasis is placed on creating a realistic three-dimensional space on the canvas through use of perspective, or classical forms of composition. Instead, subject and background merged into one, no one element more important than the other. Figures are relatively flat, and perspective is not emphasized. These choices reflect the influence of Japanese art, which displayed these characteristics.

Boticelli and Monet’s works exemplify the cultural and societal values associated with their time. Boticelli’s painting is full of realistic detail and symbolic importance, exhibiting the Renaissance ideal of fusing art with intellectual traditions such as the natural sciences, history, and mythology. It also displays the influence over art that the ruling classes of Europe had, and how these powerful people used art to signify their importance and sophistication. On the other hand, Monet’s work simply offers an expressive, sun-dappled view into an ordinary scene, populated by ordinary, modern people in candid, natural poses. This difference shows that Western culture changed from being culturally dominated by powerful elites and the church, to the more egalitarian modern world we inhabit today. Impressionists ushered in the modern age by reflecting reality as they experienced it subjectively, not as it was supposed to appear as part of carefully constructed cultural ideals. Impressionists broadened what was acceptable in art by allowing the artists themselves to be visible in the painting. Comparing the carefully composed images of Botticelli with the expressive work of Monet makes this change in society and culture visible through art.
